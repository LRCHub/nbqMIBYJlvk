I hear all your whining
All this talking on my back
The time is coming
The time has come for our attack
A new sun rising
A new ride in your world of black (/blood)
Don't try to stop me
You'll break like glass
Move over son
Your time is done
So we can't drag under our feet
The cities gone
We can see you won
'cause you can't
Take the weight
Lets go
The only way we know
Is taking you out
Did you not understand me?
Or are you not listening
Listen!
A new day dawning
And we're taking back your lies (/life)
You look so pathetic
And we're taking back control
I'm sorry but we have to let you go
Move over son
Your time is done
So we can't drag under our feet
The cities gone
We can see you won
'cause you can't
Take the weight
Lets go
The only way we know
Is taking you out
Taking you out!
